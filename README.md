## 🔄 CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment)

This project follows a simple and effective **CI/CD workflow** to ensure reliable builds and automatic deployments.

---

### 🧩 Continuous Integration (CI)

Whenever code is pushed to the main repository:

- ✔ Code is version-controlled using **Git & GitHub**
- ✔ Changes are tracked through commits and branches
- ✔ Build readiness is automatically verified by the deployment platform
- ✔ Static files (HTML, CSS, JS) are checked for successful compilation

This helps maintain:
- Clean codebase
- Consistent updates
- Reduced deployment errors

---

### 🚀 Continuous Deployment (CD)

The project is configured for **automatic deployment** using a hosting platform like **Vercel / Netlify**.

#### Deployment Flow:
1. Developer pushes code to the `main` branch
2. GitHub triggers the deployment pipeline
3. Hosting platform pulls the latest code
4. Project is built and deployed automatically
5. Live website updates instantly without manual steps

---

### 🛠 Tools Used
- **Git** – Source control
- **GitHub** – Repository & CI trigger
- **Netlify ** – Hosting & automated deployment
- ** CDN** – Dependency handling (AOS, Swiper, Typed.js)

---



✅ This CI/CD setup ensures the portfolio remains **stable, scalable, and always up-to-date**.
